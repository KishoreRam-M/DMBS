### Key Pseudocode Elements:

1. **Opening Files:** `open(fileName, "READ")` and `open(fileName, "WRITE")` are used to indicate opening the file in respective modes (read or write).
2. **Seek and Read/Write:** `file.seek(position)` moves to the correct position, and `file.read(recordSize)` or `file.write(newData)` simulates reading and writing operations.
3. **Conditions:** The checks for empty or deleted records are shown with `if (recordData is empty or recordData.isDeleted())`.
4. **File Closing:** `file.close()` is used after the file operation to ensure proper closure.

This pseudocode follows a structure similar to Java and avoids implementation-specific syntax, focusing on logic clarity. Let me know if you need further modifications!
