## **Topic: Two-Way Join vs Multi-Way Join**

---

### **What? (Simple Definition)**

* **Two-Way Join**: Combines data from **2 tables**.
* **Multi-Way Join**: Combines data from **3 or more tables**.

---

### **Why? (Purpose)**

Joins help us **gather related data** from different tables into one result. For example:

* Employee details + department name
* Student + marks + subject name

---

### **When to Use?**

* **Two-way**: When data is spread between **two tables only**
* **Multi-way**: When you need data from **more than two tables**

---

### **Where Used?**

* **SQL queries** for apps, dashboards, reports
* **Database query processing**
* **ETL/data warehouse pipelines**

---

### **How It Works?**

#### **Two-Way Join (Simple Match between 2 tables)**

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

* **employees** and **departments** are joined using the **department\_id** column.
* You get: `John - HR`, `Alice - Finance`, etc.

---

#### **Multi-Way Join (Chain of Joins between 3+ tables)**

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN project_assignments pa ON e.employee_id = pa.employee_id
JOIN projects p ON pa.project_id = p.project_id;
```

* This joins **4 tables**:

  * `employees` → `departments`
  * `employees` → `project_assignments` → `projects`
* You get: `John - HR - Project A`, `Alice - Finance - Project B`

### **Example Diagrams (Easy Drawer Style)**

#### **Two-Way Join:**

```
 employees table              departments table
+---------------+           +------------------+
| employee_id   |           | department_id     |
| employee_name |           | department_name   |
| department_id |<--------->| department_id     |
+---------------+           +------------------+

JOIN ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
```

#### **Multi-Way Join:**

```
 employees      departments      project_assignments      projects
+-----------+   +------------+   +-------------------+   +------------+
| emp_id    |   | dept_id    |   | emp_id            |   | proj_id    |
| name      |   | dept_name  |   | proj_id           |   | proj_name  |
| dept_id   |<->| dept_id    |   +-------------------+   +------------+
+-----------+                   ^                            ^
                                |                            |
         JOIN ON emp_id = emp_id           JOIN ON proj_id = proj_id
```

### **Quick Summary Table**

| Feature           | Two-Way Join                        | Multi-Way Join                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **No. of tables** | 2                                   | 3 or more                                      |
| **Use case**      | Simple data retrieval from 2 tables | Complex data involving multiple related tables |
| **Example**       | Employee + Department               | Employee + Department + Project + Assignment   |
| **SQL Example**   | `JOIN A ON A.id = B.id`             | Multiple `JOIN`s chaining 3+ tables            |
