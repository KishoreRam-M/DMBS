## **What is RAID?**

RAID stands for **Redundant Array of Independent Disks**.
It is a **data storage virtualization technology** that combines **multiple physical hard drives** into **one logical unit** to improve **performance**, **fault tolerance**, or both.

---

## **Why RAID?**

* **Improves speed** (read/write performance)
* **Increases reliability** (by adding redundancy)
* **Protects against disk failures**
* **Supports large data handling**

---

## **How RAID Works?**

RAID works by:

1. **Splitting (striping)** data across disks
2. **Copying (mirroring)** data to backup drives
3. **Adding parity bits** to recover lost data
   Each RAID level uses a different method.

## **RAID Catalogue (RAID Levels)**

| RAID Level        | Main Feature                                 | Advantage                           | Disadvantage               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **RAID 0**        | **Striping only**                            | High speed                          | No fault tolerance         |
| **RAID 1**        | **Mirroring only**                           | High redundancy                     | 50% storage loss           |
| **RAID 2**        | Bit-level striping with error checking       | Theoretical; rarely used            | Complex                    |
| **RAID 3**        | Byte-level striping with single parity       | Fast for large files                | Slow for multiple users    |
| **RAID 4**        | Block-level striping with single parity      | Good read speed                     | Write bottleneck           |
| **RAID 5**        | Block-level striping with distributed parity | Balanced performance and redundancy | Slow writes                |
| **RAID 6**        | Like RAID 5 + extra parity                   | Tolerates 2 disk failures           | High overhead              |
| **RAID 10 (1+0)** | Striping over mirrored pairs                 | High speed + redundancy             | Expensive (needs 4+ disks) |

## **Simple Diagram**

```text
RAID 0 - Striping
[Block A1] [Block A2] [Block A3]  
|--------|--------|--------|

RAID 1 - Mirroring
[Block A]  [Block A]  
[Block B]  [Block B]  

RAID 5 - Striping + Parity
[Block A1] [Block A2] [Parity A]  
[Block B1] [Parity B] [Block B2]  
[Parity C] [Block C1] [Block C2]
```

## **When and Where RAID is Used?**

* In **servers**, **cloud data centers**, **NAS/SAN systems**
* In **critical systems** needing uptime and data protection
* In **video editing**, **banking systems**, **databases**, etc.

---

## **Example Use Case for RAID 5**

In a bank database:

* RAID 5 provides both **good performance** and **parity-based fault tolerance**.
* Even if one disk fails, data is **reconstructed** using parity.

---

## **Conclusion**

RAID is essential in modern data storage systems for **ensuring performance, reliability, and fault tolerance**.
Different RAID levels are chosen based on **application requirements** like cost, speed, and protection.
