### 1. How does the architecture of a distributed database affect data retrieval and storage compared to a centralized system?

* Think of a centralized database like a single big library in one city. Everyone must travel to that library to borrow or return a book. If the library closes (e.g., server crash), no one can access books.
* A distributed database is like having smaller libraries in many cities. People go to their nearest library‚Äîfaster and more convenient. Even if one library closes, others stay open.

‚úÖ Pros of distributed:

* Faster access for local users
* System keeps running even if a server fails (fault tolerance)

‚ö†Ô∏è But:

* Data must be synchronized (kept up-to-date) across locations
* Harder to manage and ensure all data copies are consistent

---

### 2. What are the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems (CAP Theorem)?

Let‚Äôs say you run a pizza delivery chain with 3 goals:

* Every store has the same menu (Consistency)
* Customers always get served (Availability)
* System runs even if one store‚Äôs internet is down (Partition Tolerance)

‚ö†Ô∏è CAP Theorem says: You can only achieve 2 out of 3 at the same time.

Examples:

* Banking apps often prioritize Consistency & Partition Tolerance (correct balances > always responding)
* Social media may prefer Availability & Partition Tolerance (show old data instead of nothing)

üß† Tip: Choose trade-offs based on what your app values more‚Äîaccuracy or uptime.

### 3. How do access control mechanisms help ensure that only authorized users can interact with specific database objects?

Imagine a school:

* Students need ID cards to enter (Authentication)
* Not all students can enter the staff room (Authorization)
* Security cameras record who enters and when (Auditing)

In databases:

* Users must log in (authentication)
* Roles determine what they can see or change (authorization)
* Logs track actions (auditing)

üéØ Result: Keeps your data safe from unauthorized access or misuse.

### 4. When is a document-based database better than a key-value store in NoSQL?

üîë Key-Value store = Locker with a label (key) and a simple item inside (value). Great for:

* Fast lookups
* Simple apps like session storage or caching

üìÑ Document-based = Filing cabinet with folders (JSON-like documents) that have structured data. Great for:

* User profiles, blog posts, products with details
* Apps needing search/filter (querying fields inside documents)

Choose document-based when you need:

* Flexible schema (no fixed tables)
* Rich queries
* Nested data (e.g., user has name, address, preferences)

---

### 5. Why is distributed query processing more challenging than in centralized databases?

Running a query in one place (centralized) is like asking one chef to cook in one kitchen.

In a distributed database:

* Ingredients are in multiple kitchens
* Chefs must coordinate
* Some kitchens may be far away (network delays)

Problems:

* Delay due to travel (network latency)
* Different kitchens might have different versions of ingredients (data consistency)
* Costly to move ingredients around (data movement)

Solutions:

* Store related data together
* Reduce travel (optimize query paths)
* Cache results to avoid repeated work

---

### 6. How does query optimization differ in distributed databases?

In a regular system (single-node), optimization focuses on:

* CPU, RAM, disk of one machine

In a distributed system:

* Must also think about:

  * Where data lives (avoid moving too much across network)
  * Running multiple query parts in parallel (parallel processing)
  * Network speed and load

Think of it like planning a delivery:

* In one city: focus on shortest path
* Across cities: factor in traffic, fuel, number of trucks (nodes)

---

### 7. What is data fragmentation and how does it affect query performance?

üß© Data fragmentation = Breaking large datasets into smaller chunks (fragments) and storing them in different places.

Pros:

* Speeds up local access
* Reduces storage load per server

Cons:

* Queries that need data from multiple fragments take longer
* More complex joins

‚úÖ To optimize:

* Place frequently used data together (based on usage patterns)
* Copy key fragments across nodes (replication)
* Smart query planning to reduce fragment access

---

### 8. What causes SQL injection and how to prevent it?

SQL injection happens when:

* User inputs are used directly in SQL queries
* Malicious users can trick the database into running harmful commands

Example:
If input = ' OR 1=1; -- it can bypass login security

üõ°Ô∏è Prevent it using:

* Parameterized queries (use placeholders like ?)
* Input validation (check format, type, and length)
* Escaping dangerous characters (e.g., quotes)

Tools like PreparedStatement in Java, PDO in PHP, or parameterized queries in Python can help.

---

### 9. How to ensure data consistency in a distributed database with multiple updates?

When different nodes update the same data, conflicts can occur.

üß† Solutions:

* Consensus algorithms (like Raft or Paxos): nodes agree on changes
* Version control: track who updated what and when
* Synchronous replication: all nodes update at once (slower but safer)

Trade-off: More consistency = less speed and availability

---

### 10. Best NoSQL model for high availability and fault tolerance?

‚úÖ Cassandra or MongoDB are great options.

Why?

* They store multiple copies of data across nodes (replication)
* If one node fails, another responds (failover)
* Easy to add more nodes (horizontal scaling)

Used in: Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp

Perfect for:

* Messaging apps
* Shopping carts
* Real-time analytics

---

### 11. How to improve slow query performance in a distributed database?

Imagine you run a food delivery app across cities:

* Don‚Äôt ask every store for every order
* Keep popular data nearby

‚úÖ Strategies:

* Data localization: put related data on same node
* Query parallelization: split and run on multiple nodes
* Indexing: make searches faster
* Caching: save frequent query results

These cut down on delays and reduce unnecessary data movement.

---

### 12. How to defend against frequent SQL injection attacks?

üí° Golden rule: Never trust user input.

Steps:

* Use parameterized queries always
* Validate inputs (e.g., only allow valid email format)
* Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to block known attack patterns
* Regularly scan your code and database for vulnerabilities

‚úÖ Bonus: Use stored procedures instead of building SQL dynamically

---

### 13. How to model user profiles with relationships in a document-based NoSQL database?

Use JSON-like documents.

Example:

{
"userId": "u123",
"name": "Kishore",
"email": "[kishore@example.com](mailto:kishore@example.com)",
"friends": \[
{"userId": "u456", "name": "Priya"},
{"userId": "u789", "name": "Rahul"}
],
"posts": \[
{"postId": "p1", "content": "Hello world!", "timestamp": "2025-01-01"}
]
}

‚úÖ Embedded relationships = quick access
‚úÖ Referenced relationships = better when relationships grow large

---

### 14. What are flow control mechanisms and how do they protect the database?

Flow control = Managing how users and systems interact with the database safely

It includes:

* Access Control (who can do what)
* Transaction control (ensures all or nothing changes)
* Rate limiting (prevent overload or abuse)
* Role-based access (admins vs regular users)

Imagine a nightclub:

* Bouncer checks ID (authentication)
* VIP area access is restricted (authorization)
* Cameras monitor activity (auditing)

Same logic applies to secure databases.
