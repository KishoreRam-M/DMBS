### **1. Data Storage Structure**

* **Column-based NoSQL (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase)**

  * Stores data **column-wise**, i.e., values of a single column are stored together.
  * Optimized for **reading specific columns** quickly, which is ideal for analytical queries that only need a subset of fields.

* **Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**

  * Stores data **row-wise**, i.e., all fields of a record are stored together.
  * Better for **transactional systems** where entire records are frequently read or written.

---

### **2. Performance for Real-Time Analytics**

* **Column-based NoSQL**

  * **Faster read performance** for analytical queries across large datasets.
  * Efficient for queries like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, etc., over a column.
  * Supports **high write throughput** (especially Cassandra, HBase).

* **RDBMS**

  * Can slow down with large volumes of real-time data.
  * Not optimized for scanning large datasets for a few columns.
  * Write operations can be slower due to **ACID** properties and **indexes**.

---

### **3. Scalability**

* **Column-based NoSQL**

  * **Horizontally scalable**: can easily scale out by adding more nodes.
  * Handles high-velocity, high-volume data well.

* **RDBMS**

  * Mostly **vertically scalable**: scaling means upgrading to a bigger server.
  * Limited in handling massive, distributed data without extra effort.

---

### **4. Flexibility and Schema**

* **Column-based NoSQL**

  * **Schema-less** or flexible schema.
  * Can evolve with data easily, suitable for dynamic data.

* **RDBMS**

  * **Strict schema**: each table has defined columns and data types.
  * Schema changes can be difficult and time-consuming.

---

### **5. Data Consistency**

* **Column-based NoSQL**

  * Often follows **eventual consistency** model (for speed and availability).
  * May not be suitable where strong consistency is required.

* **RDBMS**

  * Offers **strong consistency** and full **ACID** compliance.
  * Ensures accurate and reliable transactions.
