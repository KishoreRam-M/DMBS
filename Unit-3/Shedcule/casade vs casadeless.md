| **Aspect**                   | **Cascading Serializable Schedule**                                                                                                                                                    | **Cascadeless Serializable Schedule**                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | A schedule where transactions can read uncommitted data, but the overall schedule can be serialized to maintain consistency.                                                           | A stricter schedule where transactions can only read committed data, ensuring that there are no dirty reads or cascading rollbacks.                       |
| **Dirty Reads**              | **Allowed** — Transactions can read uncommitted data from other transactions.                                                                                                          | **Not Allowed** — Transactions can only read committed data.                                                                                              |
| **Cascading Rollbacks**      | **Possible** — If a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction and the latter aborts, the former may need to roll back.                                               | **Not Possible** — Since transactions only read committed data, there is no risk of cascading rollbacks.                                                  |
| **Concurrency**              | **Higher** — Allows more concurrency because transactions can interact with uncommitted data.                                                                                          | **Lower** — Lower concurrency because transactions must wait until the data they are reading is committed.                                                |
| **Transaction Dependency**   | **Exists** — Transactions may become dependent on the commit of another transaction. If one transaction aborts, others that have read its uncommitted data may need to be rolled back. | **None** — No transactions depend on others, as all transactions only work with committed data.                                                           |
| **Consistency**              | **Can Be At Risk** — Since dirty reads are allowed, the system could end up in an inconsistent state if a transaction reads uncommitted data that later gets rolled back.              | **Guaranteed** — Since dirty reads are prevented, the database maintains consistency, avoiding errors from uncommitted data.                              |
| **Rollback Handling**        | **Cascading Rollbacks** — If a transaction reads uncommitted data and the original transaction aborts, all dependent transactions must also roll back.                                 | **Isolated Rollbacks** — Rollbacks are limited to the transaction itself and do not affect other transactions.                                            |
| **Conflict Serializability** | **Ensured** — Even though transactions read uncommitted data, the schedule can still be made conflict serializable, ensuring a final consistent state.                                 | **Ensured** — As no dirty reads occur, the schedule is guaranteed to be conflict serializable.                                                            |
| **Example**                  | **Example 1:** T1 writes A, T2 reads A (uncommitted), then T1 aborts. T2 must also abort due to the dirty read.                                                                        | **Example 2:** T1 writes A, T2 waits until T1 commits before reading A. No cascading rollback happens even if T1 aborts.                                  |
| **Performance Impact**       | **Potential Performance Hit** — Although concurrency is higher, the possibility of cascading rollbacks may reduce overall performance due to rollback handling.                        | **Stable Performance** — While concurrency is lower, performance is more predictable as there is no need for cascading rollbacks or handling dirty reads. |
| **Example of Schedule**      | **T1**: Write(A) <br> **T2**: Read(A) (uncommitted) <br> **T1**: Commit <br> **T2**: Write(B)                                                                                          | **T1**: Write(A) <br> **T2**: Read(A) (committed only) <br> **T1**: Commit <br> **T2**: Write(B)                                                          |
| **Usage in Real-World**      | Suitable in environments where concurrency is more important than ensuring no dirty reads (e.g., non-critical applications).                                                           | Preferred in environments where database consistency and integrity are paramount (e.g., financial systems).                                               |
