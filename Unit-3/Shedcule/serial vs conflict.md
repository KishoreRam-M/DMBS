| **Aspect**                   | **Serial Schedule**                                           | **Non-Serial Schedule**                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Execution Order**          | Transactions are executed one after another, without overlap. | Operations of different transactions are interleaved.                                      |
| **Concurrency**              | No concurrency — only one transaction executes at a time.     | Concurrency exists — multiple transactions execute in parallel.                            |
| **Interleaving**             | No interleaving of operations between transactions.           | Operations from different transactions are interleaved.                                    |
| **Database Consistency**     | Always consistent as there are no interleaved operations.     | May or may not be consistent; needs to be checked for serializability.                     |
| **Conflict Serializability** | Implicitly conflict serializable.                             | Needs to be checked for conflict serializability to ensure correctness.                    |
| **Performance**              | May be slower due to lack of concurrency.                     | Faster due to concurrent execution, but requires careful conflict management.              |
| **Example**                  | T1: `Read(A)`, `Write(A)`<br> T2: `Read(B)`, `Write(B)`       | T1: `Read(A)`, `Write(A)`<br> T2: `Read(B)`, `Write(B)`<br> T1: `Write(A)`, T2: `Write(B)` |
