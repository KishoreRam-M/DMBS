# Concurrency Control Issues in Database Transactions

Concurrency control in databases ensures that transactions are executed in a way that prevents inconsistencies, even when multiple transactions are processed simultaneously. However, when **READ** and **WRITE** operations are not managed properly, various problems can occur. Below are the common issues in concurrency control:

---

## 1. **Dirty Read**
   - **What is it?**  
     A **dirty read** occurs when a transaction reads data that is being modified by another transaction, but the changes have not been committed yet.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     The first transaction may be working with **inconsistent** or **incorrect** data if the second transaction is rolled back.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** changes `A = 10` but has not yet committed.
     - **T2** reads `A`, thinking it's 10.
     - If **T1** rolls back, **T2** worked with data that was never final.

   - **Solution:**  
     Ensure that only **committed data** is read. Use **Read Committed** isolation level.

---

## 2. **Non-Repeatable Read**
   - **What is it?**  
     A **non-repeatable read** happens when a transaction reads a value, and another transaction modifies that value before the first transaction finishes.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     The value read by the first transaction changes unexpectedly, leading to **inconsistent results**.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** reads `A = 5`.
     - **T2** changes `A` to 10.
     - **T1** reads `A` again, but now it’s 10, not 5.
   
   - **Solution:**  
     Lock the data being read so that it can't be changed while the transaction is active. Use **Repeatable Read** isolation level.

---

## 3. **Phantom Read**
   - **What is it?**  
     A **phantom read** occurs when a transaction reads a range of data (e.g., all records where `A > 5`), but another transaction modifies the dataset by adding, deleting, or modifying rows during the transaction.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     The dataset that the transaction is working with changes unexpectedly, which could lead to **incorrect results**.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** reads all rows where `A > 5`.
     - **T2** inserts a new row with `A = 10`.
     - **T1** now reads an additional row that wasn’t there initially.
   
   - **Solution:**  
     Lock the entire dataset to prevent changes during the transaction. Use **Serializable** isolation level.

---

## 4. **Lost Update**
   - **What is it?**  
     A **lost update** happens when two transactions read the same data and both update it, but one of the updates is lost because the second transaction overwrites it.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     One transaction’s changes are completely **overwritten** by another, leading to loss of data.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** reads `A = 5`, then updates `A` to 10.
     - **T2** reads `A = 5`, then updates `A` to 20.
     - After both finish, **A** is 20, and **T1’s change** is lost.
   
   - **Solution:**  
     Use **locking** to ensure that only one transaction can write to the data at a time. Alternatively, use **Serializable** isolation.

---

## 5. **Write-Write Conflict**
   - **What is it?**  
     A **write-write conflict** occurs when two transactions try to write to the same data at the same time.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     It is unclear which transaction's write operation should prevail, leading to **unpredictable results**.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** writes `A = 10`.
     - **T2** writes `A = 20`.
     - After both finish, we don’t know whether `A` should be 10 or 20.
   
   - **Solution:**  
     Use **locking** mechanisms to ensure that one transaction completes before another can begin writing to the same data.

---

## 6. **Write Skew**
   - **What is it?**  
     **Write skew** happens when two transactions read data, perform calculations, and write their results, but the final state is inconsistent.
     
   - **Why is it a problem?**  
     The final result might break consistency constraints, especially when different pieces of data should be **mutually dependent**.
   
   - **Example:**  
     - **T1** reads `A = 5`, then writes `A = 10`.
     - **T2** reads `B = 5`, then writes `B = 10`.
     - However, `A` and `B` should have been related and the final result is inconsistent.
   
   - **Solution:**  
     Use **Serializable** isolation to prevent conflicts like this and ensure data consistency.

---

## **How to Fix These Problems?**

Various **isolation levels** control the concurrency of transactions and help prevent these issues:

1. **Read Committed**: Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.
2. **Repeatable Read**: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but still allows phantom reads.
3. **Serializable**: The strictest isolation level, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

These isolation levels ensure that transactions are executed in a way that maintains **data consistency** and prevents concurrency issues.

## **Conclusion**

Concurrency control problems such as **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **lost updates** can significantly impact database accuracy and integrity. Using appropriate **isolation levels** and **locking** mechanisms is essential for ensuring that multiple transactions can execute simultaneously without causing data inconsistencies.

By managing **READ** and **WRITE** operations carefully, we can prevent these concurrency issues and guarantee the correctness of the database.
