| **Definition**            | A schedule is **conflict serializable** if we can rearrange the operations so that they follow the order of a **serial schedule**, but only by swapping **non-conflicting operations**. | A schedule is **view serializable** if the final outcome (result) of the schedule is the same as a **serial schedule**, no matter how the operations are interleaved.              |
| **Key Concept**           | Looks at **conflicts** between operations (write-write, read-write, or write-read conflicts) to determine serializability.                                                              | Focuses on **logical equivalence** — ensuring that the final result of reads and writes matches a serial schedule’s result.                                                        |
| **Dependency**            | Based on **conflicting operations**: operations are considered to conflict if they access the same data and at least one is a write.                                                    | Based on the **view** (values read and written): the schedule must match the serial schedule’s results, even if operations are interleaved differently.                            |
| **Safety**                | If two operations conflict, they must appear in the same order in any serializable schedule (no reordering of conflicting operations).                                                  | Ensures that the **first read** and **final write** of each data item in the schedule match the serial schedule's first read and final write.                                      |
| **How to Check**          | Check using a **conflict graph** (precedence graph). If there’s a cycle, the schedule is **not** conflict serializable.                                                                 | Check by comparing the **final values** of the schedule with the serial schedule to see if the final result matches.                                                               |
| **Performance**           | **More restrictive** because it forces conflicting operations to follow strict rules, reducing parallelism.                                                                             | **More relaxed**, allowing for more parallel transactions as long as the final result matches a serial schedule.                                                                   |
| **Parallel Execution**    | More **restrictive** because it limits the number of operations that can happen in parallel (due to strict conflict management).                                                        | Allows **more parallelism** because it’s focused on the final result, not the exact order of operations.                                                                           |
| **Real-World Example**    | Think of **conflict serializability** like **traffic lights**: the cars (transactions) must follow strict rules for safety.                                                             | Think of **view serializability** like a **puzzle**: the pieces (operations) can be rearranged, but the final picture (result) must be the same.                                   |
| **Example in a Database** | In a database, **conflict serializability** checks if the order of conflicting operations can be rearranged without causing errors.                                                     | **View serializability** checks if the data read and written by transactions in the schedule gives the same result as a serial schedule, no matter the interleaving of operations. |

### Breakdown of Differences:

1. **Conflict Serializability**:

   * **What it cares about**: The **order of conflicting operations**.
   * **How we check it**: Using a **conflict graph** (if there’s a cycle, it's not conflict serializable).
   * **Strict or Flexible**: **Strict**. Only certain orders of operations are allowed.
   * **Real-life analogy**: Like **traffic lights**, where conflicting cars must wait for the green light in a strict order.

2. **View Serializability**:

   * **What it cares about**: The **final result** of the schedule, no matter how operations are interleaved.
   * **How we check it**: We ensure the **final outcome** (values read and written) matches a serial schedule.
   * **Strict or Flexible**: **Flexible**. As long as the final result is the same, the order of operations can differ.
   * **Real-life analogy**: Like solving a **puzzle**: the pieces can be rearranged, but the final picture (the result) must be the same.

### Simple Example to Understand:

* **Conflicting Operations**:

  * If **T1** writes to **A** and **T2** reads **A** (and **T1**'s write is before T2's read), this is a conflict because **T2** might read the wrong value.

* **Conflict Serializability**:

  * We need to make sure that the order of conflicting operations follows a serial order.
  * In this case, **T1's write** must happen **before T2's read**. If we swap the operations (e.g., **T2** reads before **T1** writes), the schedule might not be conflict serializable.

* **View Serializability**:

  * If, after all operations, **T2 reads A** and gets the same value it would have gotten in a serial schedule (whether **T1** writes before or after), then the schedule is view serializable.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Conflict Serializability** is **more strict** and focuses on ensuring operations happen in a certain order to avoid conflicts.
* **View Serializability** is **more flexible**, allowing more parallelism as long as the final result matches what would happen in a serial schedule.
