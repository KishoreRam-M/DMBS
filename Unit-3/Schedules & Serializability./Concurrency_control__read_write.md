| **Problem**             | **What Happens**                                                                                                                                                       | **How to Fix It**                                                                                                                |

| **Lost Update**         | Two transactions try to update the same data at the same time. One update gets overwritten, losing the other transaction's changes.                                    | **Lock the data** so that only one transaction can update it at a time. Use **serializability control** to avoid conflict.       |
| **Dirty Read**          | A transaction reads data that another transaction has changed but not committed yet. If the second transaction rolls back, the data becomes invalid.                   | **Use isolation levels** like **Read Committed** to ensure you only read committed data.                                         |
| **Uncommitted Data**    | A transaction reads data that another transaction has modified but may eventually roll back. This can lead to reading data that doesn’t exist anymore.                 | Use **Serializable** or **Repeatable Read** isolation levels to ensure data is consistent and won’t change unexpectedly.         |
| **Non-Repeatable Read** | A transaction reads the same data twice but gets different values because another transaction modified the data in between the reads.                                  | **Use Repeatable Read** isolation level to prevent other transactions from modifying the data while your transaction is running. |
| **Phantom Read**        | A transaction reads a set of rows (e.g., based on a condition), but another transaction inserts or deletes rows that fit the condition, causing changes in the result. | Use **Serializable** isolation level to lock the data set, ensuring no changes happen during the transaction.                    |
