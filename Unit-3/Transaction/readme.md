## 📚 What You'll Learn

✨ This folder helps you understand how database systems maintain **data integrity**, even in the event of **system failures** or **concurrent transactions**.

- ✅ DBMS responsibilities during a transaction
- 🔁 Transaction lifecycle with real-world state flow
- 🔒 ACID principles: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- 💸 Transaction SQL example: Bank Transfer (₹1000 A → B)
- ⚠️ Rollbacks, errors & failure handling
- 🧾 Pseudocode & practical SQL statements

## ⚙️ Real-World Example – Bank Transfer

**Scenario:**
You're transferring ₹1000 from **Account A to B**.

📌 Highlights:

* SQL illustrates step-by-step debit & credit operations.
* Ensures rollback if A has insufficient balance.
* Maintains consistency even if a failure occurs mid-operation.

## 🌀 Transaction Lifecycle

> Transactions are not always successful. Here's the possible journey:

```text
Active → Partially Committed → Committed → Terminated
Active → Failed → Aborted → Terminated
```

🧾 Learn the meaning of each state: [`transaction-states.md`](./transaction-states.md)

## ❓ Can a Failed Transaction be Committed?

**Short Answer:** ❌ No.

📖 Why not? Dive into this discussion: [`failed-to-commit.md`](./failed-to-commit.md)
