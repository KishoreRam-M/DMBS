# üíº Concurrent Execution of Transactions

## üìñ What is Concurrent Execution of Transactions?

**Concurrent execution of transactions** refers to the ability of a database management system (DBMS) to run multiple transactions **simultaneously**. While only one operation from a transaction is executed at a time, multiple transactions can be interleaved (i.e., their operations are mixed together) to **optimize system performance** and better utilize resources (like CPU, memory, and disk I/O).

### Key Characteristics:

* Two or more transactions are executed in parallel.
* Operations within each transaction still follow the transaction‚Äôs original sequence (e.g., step 1 before step 2).
* The system ensures **isolation** to avoid conflicts between transactions.

## ‚ùì Why Use Concurrent Execution of Transactions?

1. **Improve Throughput and System Performance**:

   * By allowing multiple transactions to execute at once, the system can handle more operations in less time.
   * This helps reduce **wait time** for users and ensures faster response times.

2. **Better Resource Utilization**:

   * Resources (such as CPU and memory) are better utilized by running multiple transactions simultaneously.
   * It leads to **higher overall system efficiency**.

3. **Support Multiple Users**:

   * In multi-user systems, concurrent execution ensures that users don‚Äôt have to wait for others to finish before they can access the system.
   * **Real-time systems** like banking, ticket booking, and online shopping benefit greatly from concurrency.

## üõ†Ô∏è How is Concurrent Execution of Transactions Managed?

### Steps in Managing Concurrent Transactions:

1. **Transaction Interleaving**:

   * Each transaction is split into smaller steps (operations), and these steps are **interleaved** with steps from other transactions.
   * Example: Transaction T1 and T2 are executed such that:

     * T1: Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2
     * T2: Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2
   * But these steps are interleaved, so T1‚Äôs Step 1 might be executed before T2‚Äôs Step 1, and T1‚Äôs Step 2 might follow T2‚Äôs Step 2.

2. **Concurrency Control**:

   * A DBMS uses **scheduling algorithms** to control the order of operations and avoid issues like **data corruption** and **deadlock**.
   * Techniques like **locking** and **timestamps** are commonly used.

3. **Isolation (ACID Property)**:

   * Transactions are isolated from one another to ensure that each one executes as though it were the only one running.
   * **Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads,** and **phantom reads** must be prevented to maintain consistency.

4. **Conflict and View Serializability**:

   * The system ensures that the result of interleaving operations remains **serializable**, meaning the outcome is equivalent to some **serial execution** (one transaction after another).

## ‚è∞ When Does Concurrent Execution Occur?

* **In Multi-user Systems**:

  * Systems that serve multiple users or clients (e.g., web applications, online banking systems) require concurrent transaction execution to handle simultaneous requests.

* **In High-Volume Transaction Systems**:

  * For systems that process large volumes of transactions (like e-commerce platforms, ticketing systems), concurrency improves efficiency and user experience.

* **Real-time Systems**:

  * Concurrent execution ensures minimal delays, which is crucial in systems like airline booking, ATM operations, and financial transactions.

## üìç Where is Concurrent Execution Used?

* **Databases with High User Load**:

  * Transaction processing systems like **banking databases**, **inventory management systems**, and **social media platforms** benefit from concurrent transaction execution.

* **Distributed Systems**:

  * In systems where data is spread across multiple servers or locations, concurrent execution enables the system to operate efficiently by executing tasks in parallel.

* **Multi-threaded Applications**:

  * In **multi-threaded database servers**, transactions are executed concurrently, improving overall throughput.

## üí° Examples of Concurrent Execution of Transactions

### Example 1: **Banking System**

Consider two transactions:

* **T1**: Transfer ‚Çπ500 from Account A to Account B.
* **T2**: Transfer ‚Çπ1000 from Account B to Account C.

In a **serial execution**, T1 would complete entirely before T2 begins. However, in a **concurrent execution**, steps from both transactions can interleave. For instance:

* T1 Step 1: Deduct ‚Çπ500 from Account A.
* T2 Step 1: Deduct ‚Çπ1000 from Account B.
* T1 Step 2: Add ‚Çπ500 to Account B.
* T2 Step 2: Add ‚Çπ1000 to Account C.

The DBMS must manage concurrency to ensure that the final account balances are correct, ensuring **atomicity, consistency, isolation**, and **durability (ACID properties)**.

### Example 2: **E-Commerce Website**

On a busy **shopping platform**, multiple users might place orders for the same product at the same time.

* **T1**: User 1 adds an item to their cart.
* **T2**: User 2 adds the same item to their cart.

The DBMS must manage concurrent execution to ensure:

* The item is only deducted from inventory once (maintaining consistency).
* User 1 and User 2 can place their orders without interfering with each other (maintaining isolation).
* If the item runs out of stock while User 2 is checking out, the transaction must either **fail** or **be rolled back** (atomicity).
